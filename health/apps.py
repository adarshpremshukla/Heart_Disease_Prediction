from django.apps import AppConfig


class HealthConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'health'

























# The HealthConfig class is an application configuration class for the health app in a Django project. 
# It extends the AppConfig class from the django.apps module and sets the name attribute to 'health', 
# which is the name of the Django app.

# In a Django project, the app configuration is usually defined in the apps.py file inside the app 
# directory. The AppConfig class allows you to specify various configuration options for your app, such as 
# the name of the app, the label to use for the app in the admin interface, and any application-specific 
# settings. By default, Django looks for an AppConfig subclass in the apps.py file of each app in the 
# project.
