DOCTOR_STATUS = ((1, 'Authorize'), (2, 'UnAuthorize'))


# DOCTOR_STATUS is a tuple of tuples containing two elements each. The first element of each tuple is 
# an integer representing a status code and the second element is a string representing the corresponding
#  status name. In this case, 1 corresponds to "Authorize" and 2 corresponds to "UnAuthorize". This can 
# be used as a field choice in a Django model field with choices option.
