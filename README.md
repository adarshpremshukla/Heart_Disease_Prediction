## Abstract 
<p> 
  Nowadays, heart disease is the most common disease. But, unfortunately, the treatment of heart disease is somewhat costly and is not affordable for the common man. Hence, we can reduce this problem in some amount just by predicting heart disease before it becomes dangerous using Heart Disease Prediction System Using Machine Learning and Data mining. If we can find heart disease problems in the early stages then it becomes very helpful for treatment. Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques are used for the construction of the Heart Disease Prediction System. In the healthcare biomedical field, there is a large use of healthcare data in the form of text, images, etc. but, that data is hardly visited and is not mined. So, we can avoid this problem by introducing the Heart Disease Prediction System. This system will help us reduce the costs and enhance the quality of treatment of heart patients. This system can able to identify complex problems and can able to make intelligent medical decisions. The system can predict the likelihood of patients getting heart problems by their profiles such as blood pressure, age, sex, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Also, the performance will be compared by calculation of the confusion matrix. This can help to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall. The overall system provides high performance and better accuracy.

## Introduction
<p>
  The Heart Disease Prediction project is a web application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a user having heart disease. The project has been designed using the Django web framework, which provides a robust and scalable platform for developing web applications. The Heart Disease Prediction project collects various health-related inputs from the user, such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. It then uses these inputs to generate an accurate prediction of the probability of heart disease. The system employs machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Byes to analyze the data and generate predictions. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, which are well-suited for analyzing complex datasets and identifying patterns that might not be readily apparent to humans. By training these algorithms on a large dataset of health-related inputs and outcomes, the system can generate more accurate predictions than traditional rule-based systems. Heart disease is a prevalent health condition affecting millions of people worldwide, making it a significant public health concern. By developing an accurate prediction system, the Heart Disease Prediction project can help identify individuals who are at risk of heart disease, allowing for earlier intervention and treatment. The Heart Disease Prediction project provides a web-based interface that is accessible from any device with an internet connection. This means that users can quickly and easily input their health data and receive a prediction, making it a convenient and user-friendly solution. The project has been developed using various technologies such as Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to enter their health data and receive a prediction. The system aims to provide an early warning system for heart disease, helping users to be more aware of their health status and make lifestyle changes if necessary. The Heart Disease Prediction project has the potential to improve public health by raising awareness about heart disease and motivating users to adopt a healthier lifestyle. By utilizing the Django web framework, the project is well-positioned to provide a robust and scalable solution for predicting heart disease, benefiting both the users and healthcare professionals.
